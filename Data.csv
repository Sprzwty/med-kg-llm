Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer; it also strikes adults of all ages.
"Malignant transformation and uncontrolled proliferation of an abnormally differentiated, long-lived hematopoietic progenitor cell results in a high circulating number of blasts, replacement of normal marrow by malignant cells, and the potential for leukemic infiltration of the central nervous system (CNS) and testes."
"Symptoms include fatigue, pallor, infection, bone pain, CNS symptoms (eg, headache), easy bruising, and bleeding."
Examination of peripheral blood smear and bone marrow is usually diagnostic.
"Treatment typically includes combination chemotherapy to achieve remission, intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy and/or corticosteroids for CNS prophylaxis, and sometimes cerebral irradiation for intracerebral leukemic infiltration, consolidation chemotherapy with or without stem cell transplantation, and maintenance chemotherapy for up to 3 years to avoid relapse."
